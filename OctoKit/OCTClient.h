// Authorization is done using a client-side OAuth flow. This allows native apps

//   * Use the APIs below to request authorization for the user, with the client
//     ID and secret for your OAuth app.
//   * Use the OCTAuthorization's token and

// Note that because the client secret will be embedded in your app and sent
// over the user's internet connection, the secret isn't terribly secret. To
// help mitigate the risk of a web app stealing and using your client ID and
// secret, set your the Callback URL for your OAuth app to a URL you control.
