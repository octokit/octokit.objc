# OctoKit

OctoKit is a Cocoa and Cocoa Touch framework for interacting with the [GitHub
API](http://developer.github.com), built using
[AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking),
[Mantle](https://github.com/github/Mantle), and
[ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa).

## Getting Started

OctoKit is still new and moving fast, so we may make breaking changes from
time-to-time, but it has partial unit test coverage and is already being used
in GitHub for Mac's production code.

To start building the framework, clone this repository and then run `git
submodule update --init --recursive`. This will automatically pull down any
dependencies. Then, simply open `OctoKit.xcworkspace` and build.

## License

OctoKit is released under the MIT license. See
[LICENSE.md](https://github.com/Octokit/octokit.objc/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
